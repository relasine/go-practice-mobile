# Go Practice!

#### About -

Go Practice is a full stack application for music classes practice card management designed and developed by Kevin Simpson. This repo is for the student-facing React Native front end that is designed specifically for students to log daily practice routines and submit them to a database where they can be tracked and monitored by their music teachers.

#### Why Go Practice? -

As a former music teacher, managing practice cards was a huge pain. Students would lose them, forget to turn them in, they'd have to be collected and managed, and it was generally not a pleasant affair. Go Practice is designed to take the hassle out of the practice card process by making the logging of practice cards quick and easy and the tracking of it by teachers as easy as a few clicks of the mouse.

#### Tech Stack -

The front end for the student-facing interface is built with React Native. The teacher portal applications are currently under development in React with D3 for data analysis. The back end is built in Node.js utilizing Express, Postgres, and Knex.
